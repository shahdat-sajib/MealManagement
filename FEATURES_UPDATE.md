### ðŸ“Š **Calculation Logic:**

#### **Daily Expense Calculation:**
```
Daily Cost Per Meal = Total Purchases for Day Ã· Total Meals for Day
User Daily Expense = User's Meals Ã— Daily Cost Per Meal
```

#### **Weekly Totals:**
```
Week Balance = Week Purchases - Week Expenses
```

#### **Final Balance with Advance:**
```
Raw Balance = Total Purchases - Total Expenses
Final Balance = Raw Balance + Advance Balance

If Final Balance < 0: User owes money (Due)
If Final Balance > 0: User gets money back (Credit)
```
